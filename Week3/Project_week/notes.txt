Goal of a Project: Building a portfolio for potential employers or exploring new technologies/improving your understanding with languages.


Your goal in Project Week: 
Building your MVP ( Minimal viable product )

Sources of Inspiration: Expedia, Airliners, Google Maps/Other trip assitance, etc...

Example: Trip Planner App MVP:

    - Allowing users to register and record their trip plans
    - The ability to schedule/record what the trip is. (Such as the start and end time of your trip)

    -> Incorporate a new technology/feature to the app that goes beyond a simple Flask CRUD application that we covered in the material.

        - New Tech Ideas for the Trip Planner:
            1. API to check hotel availability/AirBnB
            2. API for tracking location/distance. (Google Maps)
            3. Create using the Django framework 

    Aggregating Data:
        - Calculate the trip's length, what to pack based on weather, etc. to give recommendations.
        - Getting Hotels/Locations to visit based on the trip destination that is used. 



Expectations for Projects in Week 4:

Monday -> You have a project idea and a wireframe. (Also a github Repo/Trello board is ideal!)
        -> Your project idea should be what your MVP is and what the additional features are.

Tuesday -> The project is started, and some of the views are created/usable!
            -> Database is online/mapped out and ready to use.

Wednesday -> Continue to expand on the wireframe and build your application/test additional features.
            -> Re-evaluate if you will make the Friday deadline, and then adjust if needed.

Thursday -> Finalizing your MVP in time for Friday Morning.
            -> Having your MVP as close to finished as possible, the minimum requirement is things we've covered in the course. I.E. Flask CRUD full stack application.

Friday -> Finalize any last minute features and prepare for presentations
            -> You can present your project to everyone at Coding Dojo at Graduation.
